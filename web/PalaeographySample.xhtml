        <h1> Palaeography Samples</h1>
        <p>One of the more challenging parts of working with medieval and early modern documents is
            that their handwriting differed from ours, sometimes significantly. At first, the novice
            palaeographer may well look at a sheet of illegible chickenscratch and despair of ever
            being able to read it. But with a little practice, you will find that everything starts
            to fall into place.</p>
        <p>Naturally, it is more challenging if the scribe is writing unfamiliar words, or
            unfamiliar spellings of familiar words, or above all, in an altogether unfamiliar
            language.</p>
        <p>In this case, we are looking at a Latin document written in 1685. To make matters worse,
            this manuscript was damaged by water in the 1720s or 1730s, leading some of the pages to
            become translucent or blotchy. Nonetheless, this image is from a clear part of the text.
            As you will see, the scribe's handwriting, while somewhat unfamiliar, is at least clear
            and consistent -- and in fact rather attractive without being over the top.</p>
        <p> Begin reading at the bold capital S in the fourth line.</p>

        <p>You will note that there are several abbreviations in this text. Medieval handwriting,
            especially Latin, tended to be far more heavily abbreviated, but at least its
            abbreviations were highly standardized. Even here, in a post-medieval hand, the
            abbreviations are fairly consistent: Ep~us will always mean Episcopus (bishop), and a
            line over a letter usually means that an m or an n should be inserted after that letter.
