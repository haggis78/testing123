        <h1>Overview: Eurasian Travelers</h1>
        <p>In this project, we traced the itineraries of more than a dozen medieval Eurasian travelers whose routes corresponded, more or less, to the "Silk Roads". Below you will find an <a href="#list">annotated list</a> and an <a href="#map">interactive map</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="map">Interactive map</h2>
        <p>The following map contains many layers that can be turned on and off. Click the icon in the upper left of the map window to show the list of layers, and use the tick boxes to turn them on and off. The map can be panned and dragged around, and you can zoom in and out. You can also click the icon in the upper right corner to open it in its own tab.</p> 
        <p>The first layer (red and black) is the "Silk Roads" routes as proposed by von Richthofen in 1877. The remaining layers show the routes or itineraries of the travelers we have mapped for this project.</p>
        <p>A note of caution: many of these routes are conjectural. In particular, if you see a long straight line or arc between two points, that indicates that the route between those points is unknown. It would therefore be a mistake to assume (for example) that the Anonymous Chinese Buddhist Monk (dark brown line) crossed the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayas, which he almost certainly circumnavigated by traveling a thousand miles further to the west. In a similar vein, Rabban Sawma (Eastern Christian, orange line) crossed the Taklamakan Desert, but because his narrations of the route cannot be securely translated onto a map, we do not know for sure whether he took the more northerly or southerly route. The more jagged a route is on this map, in general, the more likely it is to represent a route that has been carefully described in the original source.</p>
