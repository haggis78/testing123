        <h1>Samarkand</h1>
        <p>Founded around the year 700 BCE Samarkand, located in modern day Uzbekistan, is among the world’s oldest continuously inhabited cities<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. The city was controlled by numerous empires during its long history. Each of these empires left distinct cultural impressions on the city that can be seen in its art and architecture<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. From the fifth to the seventh century Samarkand was part of Sogdiana. During this time the region prospered and experienced tremendous economic growth<a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. The Sogdians were known for their skills as scrupulous traders and established powerful communities throughout the Silk Road<a href="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. In 1220 much of the city was destroyed by Chinggis Khan’s Mongol army<a href="#5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. It was not until the reign of turkicized mongol ruler Timur in the late twelfth century that the much of the city was rebuilt<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. </p>
        <p>Samarkand’s location made it an important stop along the Silk Road. It was a bridge between the eastern empires, and China to the west<a href="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. Caravans could stop to rest, conduct trade, and resupply for the next part of their journey. Most of the trade done in the city would have been with neighboring towns and cities. Evidence of trade goods, with the exception of silk and paper from China, were all locally produced<a href="#6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>. Samarkand became a diverse community with the mixing of cultures from the east and west. Prior to Islamic rule there is evidence of Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, and Buddhism being practiced in the city<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Murals from the Afrasiab site in Samarkand reveal the city’s political importance. Emissaries from as far as the Korean peninsula are depicted visiting the Sogdian ruler<a href="#7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. </p>
        <p>Two of Samarkand’s most famous sites are the Bibi-Khanum Mosque and the Gur-Amir mausoleum<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. Commissioned by the ruler Timur in the twelfth century, these buildings became some of the grandest architectural projects in the Islamic world. The impressive Bibi-Khanum Mosque still stands today and is the largest mosque in Central Asia<a href="#8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>. Timur’s grandson Ulugh Beg ascended to the throne in 1409. During his rule the city became a hub for the arts and sciences<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. Ulugh Beg along with other early astronomers observed the night sky from the city’s observatory. Excavations of the observatory revealed a catalogue of more than 1000 stars as well as calculations of the planets motions, all done without the use of a telescope<a href="#10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>The climate also played a factor in the city’s prosperity. Located on the Zaravshan river, Samarkand is an oasis surrounded by an arid plateau<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Highly developed irrigation allowed the city to cultivate crops like flax and hemp used for the manufacturing of paper. The story goes that paper making technology came to Samarkand after the battle of Tala in 751. Captured members on the Tang army were forced to divulge their knowledge of Chinese paper making technology. Although there is little credibility to this legend, we do know that shortly after, paper mills were established around Samarkand. The paper produced became known as “Samarkand paper” and was highly sought after for its quality<a href="#9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p>
