Kaitlyn,

Here is the to-do list for your traveler page:
1) Add a discussion of your source problems and why it was impossible to plot anything like a route.(Done)
2) For the few points on your map, locate the relevant passage in an online copy of the primary source, and make it so clicking on the pin on the map brings up a box with the link. We'll talk about how to do this in class on Wednesday.(Done)

Also:
1) We're missing your article about paper and papermaking.(Done)
2) people got new tasks in class on Monday. As you weren't around, I'm going to have to assign you one:
Look at the "What is the Silk Road?" page, which is actually within my student-folder, and online at https://haggis78.github.io/silkroad/student-folders/Campbell/what-is-silk-road.html
Scroll down to part 1: an overview of the Silk Road as a historical phenonemon. I'd like you to write something up here, about 300-400 words. Theoreticaly that's your homework for tomorrow, Wednesday, December 1, but since I'm only writing this up now (22 hours after class), that's not a firm deadline. Look particularly to the Introduction and Conclusion in Hansen.(Done)

I think I'll need to add one more thing to your load, because your traveler page has little left to do (and others have to find links for many dozens of places in their texts):

I'm assigning you the article on Ammonium Chloride. Not the most exciting thing, but an important Silk Road trade good.(Done)
