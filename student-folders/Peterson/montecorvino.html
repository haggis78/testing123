        <h1>Friar John of Montecorvino</h1>
        <p>John of Montecorvino was a Franciscan friar who traveled to the far east in the thirteenth century and founded the first Catholic mission in China. He departed Tabriz in 1291 with a letter for from the first Franciscan Pope Nicholas IV to Kubilai Khan leader of the Mongols. Unlike other missionaries before him, John traveled on a southern route through India. The northern route that others like John Plano-Carpini and William of Rubruck had taken had become too dangerous. We know from his letter written in 1305 that he stopped with his companions at the Church of St. Thomas the Apostle for thirteen months. While they were there, he baptized at least 100 people.<P> 
       
        <p>When Montecorvino finally reached the Mongol capital city of Khanbaliq, modern day Beijing, he was welcomed by Kubilai’s successor, Külüg Khan. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to convert the Khan to Christianity; however, he did gain patronage for his mission. The Khan even sponsored a Church that was constructed directly in front of the royal palace.<p>
        
        <p>During his time in the Mongol Capital Montecorvino established three churches and baptized thousands. After gaining sufficient knowledge of the local language, he began to preach to in public as well as translate the psalms and New Testament. He purchased 40 boys aged seven to eleven and with limited resources instructed them in the Catholic faith. These children would grow up to help Montecorvino run the three churches in the city, as well as create copies of the book of psalms he had brought with him.<p>
       
        <p>Since beginning his journey in 1291, they Church had received no word from Montecorvino. Believing that he had died, they were surprised to receive a letter from the friar 1307. The first letter detailed his travel to China as well as the success of his missions there. In his letter he requested that more friars and texts be sent to help him run the mission. The Catholic Church granted his request and consecrated him as archbishop of Khanbaliq.<p>
        
        <p>John of Montecorvino remained in Beijing until his death in 1328 at the age of 82. Montecorvino established the most successful Catholic mission in China during the Middle Ages, and he did so almost entirely on his own. The mission in Beijing continued to run after his death and was in operation until the fall of the Mongol dynasty thirty years later.</p>
