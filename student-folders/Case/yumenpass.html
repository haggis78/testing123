        <h1>THE YUMEN PASS</h1>
        <p>The Jade Gate, also known as the Yumen Pass or Jade Gate Pass, is the name of a mountain pass through the Great Wall of China that is located west of Dunhuang. This mountain pass connected Central Asia and East Asia on the Silk Road during the Han dynasty (202 BC- AD 220).<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p> Originally named the “Square City”, it is now known as the Jade Gate Pass because of the great jade caravans from Khotan traveling through.<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p> Yumen Pass was composed of 10 meter high walls made of mud (32 feet), accessed through four gateways which led into a 600 square meter square (718 square yards) hence the former name “Square City”.
        <p>Travelers would use this pass on their journey from Jiayuguan to Dunhuang in the west, which in total took up to three weeks. The city of Yumen is known for being the site of China’s first oilfield. Oil was discovered in the Qilian Mountains in Qinghai and Gansu in 1935. In 1938 during the was against Japan, the volume of drilling increased as it was a crucial tool for the war efforts. In present day Yumen, “there are now five wells with an annual output of 400,000 tons per annum, and a pipeline runs to Lanzhou.”<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
           	<p>Up until the Tang dynasty, the Yumen Pass as well as the Yangguan Pass located on either side of the Dunhuang extension of the Great Wall were utilized as a caravan checkpoint. The Yumen Pass and Yangguan Pass are about 68 kilometers (42 miles) apart from each other. The Yumen Pass is located approximately 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Dunhuang. All caravans were required to pass through one of these gates. This lasted up until the third and fourth centuries, when overland trade was disrupted by travelers using the sea route via India as well as the favored northern route via Hami, therefore the pass was abandoned.
