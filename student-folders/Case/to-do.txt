Carissa, here are the things I'd like to see done on your traveler page:
1) Complete and clean up bibliography
2) Add route lines for the part of Polo's travel that you think is reasonably likely.
3) The biggie: adding links to places in the text, so that people can click through from the map pins and go straight to the appropriate passage in Polo. I know that will be more challenging because you used a modern edition (as was right) and now you need to cross-reference that with an old edition. So let me point you in a helpful direction.

You can find the etexts in html at https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10636/pg10636-images.html (vol. 1) and https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/12410/pg12410-images.html (vol. 2). And I have good news. Within the HTML, the chapters are already tagged with id targets; so for example https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10636/pg10636-images.html#CHAPTER_Ip takes you straight to book 1, chapter 1. So if you can just link to the chapter number, that will be all you need. It's a lot of data points, though, and I'm aware of that.

We still need your Yumen Gate article on the site, and now you have one on Judaism to do as well.
