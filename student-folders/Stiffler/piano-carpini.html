        <h1>John of Plano Carpini</h1>
        <p>Friar John of Plano Carpini, natively known as Giovanni di Pian di Carpine, was born around the year 1180. John was born near modern day Perugia, Italy; eventually, he became respected within the Franciscan order. Friar John held numerous important positions across Europe, such as warden and minister. His roles were important in countries including Italy, Germany, and eventually France. Through his years in the Franciscan order, Friar John built a reputation of being a kind, respectful, and trustworthy individual.</p>
        <p>While in Cologne of the year 1241, the <a href="/testing123/student-folders/Camick/Mongols.html">Mongol</a> invasion of Europe had reached Poland. Mongolian and European forces clashed in the Battle of Liegnitz on April 9, 1241. This battle created fears and questions surrounding the Mongols and their goals. This fear and mystery surrounding the Mongols did not fade after the pinnacle battle. In fact, Pope Innocent IV would convene numerous diplomatic missions into foreign territory to pursue the knowledge of the Mongol's invasion, goals, and characteristcs. Four years after the Battle of Liegnitz would pass until the culmination of Friar Johnâ€™s journey. Pope Innocent IV convened the friar mission to the Mongols with Friar John as the group's leader. Fiar John carried a letter from Pope Innocent IV to its intended recipient, the ruler of the Mongols. He departed on this mission from Lyon, France already over 60 years old.</p>
        <p>Along the way of their early stages of the journey, one of Friar John's companions, Friar Stephen of Bohemia fell ill. However, this friar was replaced by another, a man called Benedict the Pole.Along with their new companion, the group initially made their way through Poland and Ukarine. Then they made their way through Mongol territory all the way to its capital, <a href="/testing123/student-folders/Myers/Karakorum.html">Karakorum</a>. Here, in 1246, they saw the election of the new Mongol leader named Guyuk. The group was able to accomplish their goal in giving Guyuk the Pope's letter and received a translated letter from the Mongols. From Karakorum, the group would return to Lyon in 1247.</p>
        <p>There are two separate account of the friars' journey to Karakorum: one from Friar John himself that he wrote upon returning, and one written by Benedict the Pole upon returning as well. Benedict's is substantially shorter and mostly aligns with the beginning of Friar John's. Both of these accounts are part of Friar <a href="/testing123/student-folders/Myers/wm-of-rubruk.html">William of Rubruk's</a> subsequent account of his own journey. Friar John's points are represented through the numbered blue points and route lines. Benedict the Pole's are represented by the red markers and these layers can be toggled separately on the map.
