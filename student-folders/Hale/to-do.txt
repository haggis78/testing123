Marcus,

Here's the to-do list on your traveler project:
1) Zoom in on map extent. I'll explain in person.
2) Standardize your spelling of your traveler's name.
3) Add route lines to your map.
4) The big one: add links to pages of the text. We'll talk about this in class on Wednesday.

You are up to date on your articles (you have done horses, silk, and slaves).
