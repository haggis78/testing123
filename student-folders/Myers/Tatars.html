        <h1>Tatars</h1>
        <p>The Silk Road was a vast system of pathways that connected the western portions of the Middle East to the eastern provinces of Imperial China. Many different peoples have made their domains along this road while others conquered vast swaths of territory along these pathways. From the mercantile empire of the Kushans, to the ruthlessly war-hungry Timurids – many carved out their legacies along the Silk Road. However, one group of people when compared to the others do not get much recognition for their endeavors along the Silk Road. The Tatars are a conglomeration of <a href="/testing123/student-folders/Dutrow/Turks.html">Turkic</a> tribes that are descended from the original Tatars of the same name. Regarded as the infamous rivals of the <a href="/testing123/student-folders/Camick/Mongols.html">Mongols</a> and the butchers of Chinggis Khan’s birth father, Yesugei – the Tatars have had a wide impact upon developments on the Silk Road.<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
        <p>In the modern day, most Tatars are found in Eastern Europe – the biggest conglomeration being in the Russian Federation to the point of where they are the largest ethnic and religious minority in that nation. Other communities exist in Crimea, Ukraine, Romania, with some also living in Central Asian nations such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Though, how did the Tatars who once lived in modern-day Mongolia reach those areas? In all lays within the developments of the Mongol Empire. Chinggis Khan in his beginnings as a powerful conqueror would set his eyes upon the Tatars, the hereditary enemy of his people. When he conquered the tribes of Mongolia including the Tatars, he separated them into fighting units that separated all loyalty of previous tribes to each soldier. As noted by historian David Morgan: “Tatars, Merkits, Keraits, Naimans and so forth – were broken up, and such of their men as had not been killed during the process of tribal unification were distributed among other units”.<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Due to this, Tatars were easily spread out when the Mongols set out to conquer both rivals and neighbors all. It is clear from this that many Tatars went with Jochi and Batu Khan when the Mongols invaded Russia. Thus, explaining the high presence of Tatars in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>
        <p>Tatars were notably fierce warriors, having grown and lived among the Central Asian Steppe for many centuries. Like the Mongols, they primarily served as horsemen considering their experiences fighting on horseback from their earliest days. Thus, it can explain as to why Tatars are so easily confused for Mongols. In fact, throughout many records about the Mongols – the authors constantly mistranslate or confuse their names for that of Tatars. An easy example is that of <a href="/testing123/student-folders/Myers/wm-of-rubruck.html">William of Rubruck</a>, who noted the following to King Louis IX: “But for all that, however I have acted, you told me, when I left you, to put in writing for you everything I saw among the Tartars, and further urged me not to be afraid of writing to you at length; and so I am doing as you commanded, though with fear and diffidence, since I do not have to hand the words I should use in writing to so exalted a prince”.<a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Primarily, the name Tatar itself sounds very similar to Tartarus – which many believed as another name for Hell. Thus, to paint the Mongols and their forces in a negative light – they used a name that sounded evil, demonic. Despite that, it is obvious that not all Mongols were Tatars, though the vast majority of Tatars at this time did serve as horsemen in the military and were a nomadic tribe just as the Mongols were.</p>
        <p>It should also be noted that during the Mongol Empire, many Tatars settled within Eastern Europe. As <a href="/testing123/student-folders/Stiffler/piano-carpini.html">John of Piano Carpini</a> notes: “To avoid any doubt arising in the minds of anyone as to our having been to the Tartars, we will write down the names of those with whom we came into contact there,”.<a href="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Ethnic enclaves of Tatars lived within Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus – at least the territories of those modern states. However, the vast majority of those Tatars would be differentiated at that time by keeping their nomadic way of life and Tengriist faith. Furthermore, these Tatars after the breaking of the Mongol Empire would also convert to <a href="/testing123/student-folders/Richey/Islam.html">Islam</a> just as the rest of the Golden Horde did. Thus, these Tatars brought more knowledge of Islam into Europe – giving Europeans a way to be able to learn more about Islam throughout the ages.</p>

        <p>A Tatar warrior mounted upon horseback, most likely in the Volga region. These Tatars would be the ancestors of the same modern Tatars in Crimea and other Eastern European regions, albeit they would convert to Islam when the rest of the Golden Horde did.<a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

        <p id="1">[1] The Tatars killed Chinggis Khan's (who at this time was named Temujin) father not through brutal murder but instead through poisoned food and drink.</p>
        <p id="2">[2] It should be noted that family and tribe were the most important groups among the Central Asian Steppe. From this loyalty to one another, Chinggis Khan feared they would separate from his army if given the chance to mount up a rebellion. Thus, the idea of separating the tribes into mixed units which later became the most infamous grouping of "tumens", ten-thousand horsemen bound under one commander.</p>
        <p id="3">[3] A disclaimer must be placed here, they might not have been truly ethnic "Tatars" in the same tribe that rivaled Chinggis Khan's own Instead, the Tatars being referred to would most likely be other tribes such as the Kipchaks, Cumans, possibly Kazakhs and Uzbeks under that label.</p>
        <p id="4">[4] There could very well be Tatar encampments along the journey that John of Plano Carpini made through Eastern Europe. What should be noted, is that the Tatars did make encampments where the Golden Horde raided into Russia. Thus, there might be some truth unto John's statement.</p>
