        <h1>Turfan Article</h1>
        <p>Turfan is a city in what is modern day Turpan, China, located on the northern part of the Taklamakan Desert.<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Sogdian and Chinese migrants were the main inhabitants of the city; however, its population was largely mixed and included Syrians and Uighurs as well.<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Turfan maintained a very mixed culture as well due to this. Chinese residents listened to Iranian music and the traditional Sogdian swirl dance was heavily performed. Despite this, Turfan still had much of a Chinese feel, so much so that the Sogdians referred to the city as Chinatown.<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
        <p>“The Qu-family rulers, who came to power in 502, embraced Chinese cultural norms, and, like many Chinese rulers, patronized Buddhism”. The study of the Chinese-language was taught in schools although many documents were translated into Sogdian or Kuchean. Paper was recycled from the city in order to make all forms of clothing, including belts, shoes, and even articles for the dead to be buried in. Most people travelled into the city via caravans. When no travel bans were in place, one would acquire a travel pass in order to cross the border. Guides would then lead travelers through the difficult desert routes and away from any potential disasters or dangers.<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
        <p>It is believed that Turfan probably fell under the jurisdiction of either Marv or Samarkand. This would be fair seeing that Samarkand held extremely close ties within the city, and the inhabitants of both travelled back and forth from one another. Turfan was a center for the Church of the East due to this constant migration. The Church of the East was able to keep a large proportion of its control over the city of Turfan. “The monastic complex possibly provided a stopping point for travelers, since the northern route of the Silk Road, skirting the Tarim basin, passed through Turfan”. [2]<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
        <p>Syriac fragments that have been found in the city largely embody the biblical and lectionary texts, as well as the livelihoods of saints and other clergymen. We see that much of the church’s beliefs and documents were spread out to the surrounding countries as one of the most central, cultural pieces that Turfan passed on throughout the northern route. Through its connection to the Silk Road, Turfan was able to give a first-hand, detailed account of how the Church was centralized throughout the city. The Church’s message was also given the ability to spread their mission across a wider region due to the bridge that Turfan created with its bordering cities. Overall, Turfan was quite an influential destination on the Silk Road that offered a diverse culture and an expanded religious following for the Church the East.<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
