Melissa,

On your traveler page, the only thing you really need to do right now is to clean up the bibliography.

As a reminder, you're also now working on an article on Buddhism along the Silk Road and a teacher's guide for some type of class activity. (Because our site is textual, despite the maps, this will need to be something either where students work through/explore on a computer in the classroom, or where they would do so as homework.)
