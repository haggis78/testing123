Chris,
Here's your current to-do list for your project page:
1) enlarge the iframe on the map to match those on other projects.
2) Clean up the bibliography.
3) Importantly: finish the text!

For other matters:
1) We need your article on silk making to be added to the site.
2) The Xuanzang thing. Yep. Specifically, copying the list of places into a spreadsheet. Once that's done I can spread around the job of putting co-ordinates to places.
