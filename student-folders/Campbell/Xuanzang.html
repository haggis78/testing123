           Buddhist</a> monk named Xuanzang, who lived in the seventh century CE. Xuanzang is remarkable not only as a traveler but also as a translator. Buddhism is a religion (or philosophy) with a very extensive corpus of sacred writings. It is native to India rather than China, and the earliest missionaries to enter China did not bring with them the full body of holy writings. Xuanzang's great journey was to travel to India to study and acquire Buddhist texts; and his great achievement was to translate them from their original Sanskrit into Chinese upon his return.</p>
