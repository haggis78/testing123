        <h1>Teaching resources: Other Silk Road projects</h1>
        <p>As might be expected, because the Silk Road is such an important historical and cultural phenomenon, ours is not the first online resource to feature it. These are organized below, roughly, according to how simple or complex they are for an educator to use. For example, the very first item is a one-page guide that a teacher can use to guide school-aged students through a reflection on any map; the last requires facility with GIS software at a level.</p>
        <h3>Written and visual resources</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>The Library of Congress</b> offers a <a href="https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/teachers/getting-started-with-primary-sources/documents/Analyzing_Maps.pdf">Teacher's Guide to Analyzing Maps</a>.</li>
            <li><b>The Humanities in Class Digital Library</b>, an initiative of the <a href="https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/">National Humanities Center</a>, has a series of school lesson plans for various grade levels. Because these are designed for schools, they include information for teachers on curricular alignments and standards. Visit <a href="https://education.nationalhumanitiescenter.org/">https://education.nationalhumanitiescenter.org/</a>. A free login is required.</li>
        <li><b>ESRI</b>, the company that makes ArcGIS mapping software, has produced dozens of free online map-based geographical classroom activities called <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/industries/education/schools/geoinquiries-collections">GeoInquiries</a>. Their Silk Road GeoInquiry can be found <a href="https://www.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/en-us/media/pdf/geoinquiries/world-history/7-silkroad-worldhistory-geoinquiry.pdf">here</a>. The map itself is located <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=1628ed8796134bfdbeda184069cbe9ae">here</a>. Click on "Content" and you will be able to turn individual map layers on and off. This particular activity could be used in the classroom at any level from Middle School to college.</li>
            <li><b>The Penn Museum</b> hosted an exhibition named Secrets of the Silk Road in 2011. Though the exhibition has moved on, the website is still live and can be visited <a href="https://www.penn.museum/silkroad/home.php">here</a>. It also includes <a href="https://www.penn.museum/silkroad/resources_teachers.php">teacher's guides</a>. While those guides were designed to assist teachers bringing students to the museum for the physical exhibit, they could be used or adapted by teachers having students explore the digital exhibit.</li>
            
            <li><b>The Walter Chaplin Simpson Center for the Humanites at the University of Washington</b> created a web project on the Silk Road, called <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/">Silk Road Seattle</a>, in the early 2000s. It appears that its last update was in 2008, and as might be expected, some of its links no longer work. However, it remains usable (as of this writing, 12/2021) and useful, with teachers' guides, galleries of art images, maps, and historical texts.</li>
           
            <li><b>The University of Pittsburgh Library System</b> created an exhibition on the Silk Roads in 2018-2019. Though no longer on display in the library, it lives on as <a href="https://pitt.libguides.com/silkroads">a digital exhibit</a> that is interesting to explore and easy to navigate. There does not appear to be a teacher's guide for using this in the classroom, so while it is a good resource in general, a teacher would need to find or create assignments and instructions to guide student enquiry.</li>
            <li><b>Google Arts and Culture</b> maintains <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/search?q=silk%20road">a list of digital exhibits on the Silk Road</a>. Most of these appear to be in the "story map" format, meaning that they are explored by scrolling down a long page with text and images, rather than by clicking from page to page. As such, they might be easier for younger school children to navigate than a site such as ours that has a more complex cross-linked structure.</li>
            <li><b>A broader overview of medieval trade networks</b> (specifically in the 11th and 12th centuries CE) was attractively and clearly mapped, and can be found <a href="https://imgur.com/MsXaOdV">here</a>. For a zoomable version of the map, see <a href="https://easyzoom.com/imageaccess/ec482e04c2b240d4969c14156bb6836f">here</a>.</li>
            <li><b>UNESCO</b>, The United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, has declared part of the Silk Road a World Heritage Site. Their website is <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1442/">here</a>, while a Wikipedia page dedicated to it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Roads:_the_Routes_Network_of_Chang%27an-Tianshan_Corridor">here</a>.</li> 
            <li><b>Harvard University</b> offers <a href="https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/">CHGIS</a>, The China Historical Geographic Information System.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Audio resources</h3>
        <p>There are, no doubt, many fine podcasts on the history of the Silk Road. Two of outstanding quality are linked here. They are panel-interview podcasts from the BBC, intended for the general (educated) listener; as such they are probably best for High School and university level teaching.</p>
