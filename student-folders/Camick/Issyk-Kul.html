        <h1>Issyk Kul</h1>
        
       <p>Issyk Kul is a saline lake located in what is now modern-day Kazakhstan. The large lake has no out flow and is the tenth largest lake in the world. Issyk Kul can be translated to “warm lake” in the Kyrgyz language, and though it’s in the northern part of the Tianshan Mountains surrounded by snowy mountains, the lake never freezes. One of the routes of the silk road, known as “Hsuan-Tsang’s Road”, went through towns on the southern shore of Issyk Kul, but the area itself lost traction after the end of the Mongol empire. One of the towns that gained some of the most foot traffic was the site of Barskoon, which functioned as a fortress that protected the entrance and exit from the gorge it was located in. The route that went through this site went through Barskoon and Bedel, and then passes to the area of Aksuu. The towns on the lake of Issyk Kul were so frequented that many historians believe it could be the point of origin for the Black Death that happened during the Early and mid-14th Century.</p>
