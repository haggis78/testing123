Esther, here are the things I'd like you to do on your "traveler" page:
1) The article text is not finished.
2) The bibliography needs to be finished and cleaned up.

At this moment I'm not seeing all of your other articles in the Git repo either. These are to be for Issyk-Kul and Mongols. I think you should have gotten another to do on Monday 11/29 but I'm not finding it on our list.
