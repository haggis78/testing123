        <h1>Mongols</h1>
        
        <p>The Mongol empire, which came about in the 13th century and existed though the 14th, was the largest contiguous land empire in history. It originated in Mongolia which lies in East Asia, and at its height stretched from the Sea of Japan to some parts of Eastern Europe. They were a Nomadic nation, though they controlled a vast amount of land at the time. And the head of their government was a leader called the Khan. The Mongol Empire existed in a couple different stages. The First being the Yuan Dynasty, next the Ilkhanate, then the Chaghadaid Khanate, and then lastly the Golden Hoard. Though the Fall of the Yuan is deemed by most to be the end of the Mongol period. The Mongols found textiles very important and had cultural preferences that affected their economic policies. Most of the culture that traveled throughout the country was not the Mongol’s own, but they were the ones that initiated the start of exchanges most of the time. The main ways these cultures were moved around was through diplomats, merchants, and other jobs that had very social positions. The Mongols had such a large influence on Eurasia as a whole that the only things that were sent out to the rest of the lands were things that the Mongols could benefit from. They basically controlled what influences which lands, and this is why they influenced the Silk Road so heavily. The Mongols would have controlled most of the land that housed the Silk Road for a good amount of time while it was still active. So, the Mongols would have been able to influence not only what goods are traveling though the Silk Road, but what the most important or valuable items were that they could sell or exchange.</p>
