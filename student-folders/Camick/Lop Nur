        <h1>Lop Nur</h1>
        
        <p>Lop Nur was a Salt Lake in the time of the Silk Road that hosted a very popular oasis town stop on the route. The oasis town of Lop Nur was important because it was one of the Silk Road stops that served as a buffer stop between what is currently Europe and China. It was a very bustling stop for people traveling that portion of the Silk Road, so much that the kingdom of Loulan thrived because of it. Although it was a huge stop on the Silk Road, no one at the time really knew where it was, and this lack of knowledge continued into modern times.</p>
