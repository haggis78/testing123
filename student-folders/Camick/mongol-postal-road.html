        <h1>Mongol Postal Road</h1>
        <p>Though the Mongol Postal Route is not a specific traveler on the Silk Road, it is still an important route to have as a frame of reference for the travelers. The Mongols’ route is relevant to know because these routes would essentially be highways of the Silk Road for travelers without any bulk or excess goods. The Mongol Postal routes were the some of the most efficient routes at the time for some of these travelers. Though the beginning of the system is thought to be during the reign of Ogodei Qa’an, the earliest post stations had already been set up by Chinggis Khan. </p>
      <p>Though I did not include his possible map of postal routes, in <i>The Postal Roads of the Great Khans in Central Asia under the Mongol-Yuan Empire</i>, Shim illustrates the route in Map 1. Shin is able to put together maps from a group of known and well accounted travelers for Map 2. After this he tracks the development of the Postal system and routes that the travelers take that evolve. These Postal routes were very important for travelers because it was all part of a unified state, so they did not have to worry about political problems. As well as giving them stable and easier routes to travel that have oasis towns along the way to follow, so long distance travelers could easily rest.</p>
