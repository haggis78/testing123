Nick,
Here's the to-do list on your traveler page:
1) enlarge the map to match the size others have on their pages. (I'll talk you through this.) 
2) Complete and clean up the bibliography.
3) Add links to the text: we'll talk about that on Wednesday.

Beyond that, people got new tasks in class on Monday. As you weren't around, I'm going to have to assign you one:
Look at the "What is the Silk Road?" page, which is actually within my student-folder, and online at https://haggis78.github.io/silkroad/student-folders/Campbell/what-is-silk-road.html
Scroll down to part 3: the Silk Road as a modern metaphor. I'd like you to write something up here, about 300-400 words. Theoreticaly that's your homework for tomorrow, Wednesday, December 1, but since I'm only writing this up now (22 hours after class), that's not a firm deadline.
