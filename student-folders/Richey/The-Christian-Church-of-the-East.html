        <h1>Nestorians</h1>
        <p>Religion was commonly spread amongst the Silk Road. Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism are all ideas that were embraced by multiple communities in the middle and far east. However, another religion was paving its way as well. Christianity, which is by far the largest religion today, was also on the move. Christianity has over 2 billion followers, all placed in different branches such as Catholicism or Protestantism, (TBS, 2021).<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
        <p>The Christian Church of the East was one of the many ideas being shared amongst the Silk Road. This denomination of Christianity was also referred to as Nestorianism, (Telling the Sogdian Story). This early eastern Church arose from conflicts, resulting in a denomination being based of Syriac Christian values, (Louis, 2013). The Nestorian Church also based its foundation off the beliefs and teaching of Nestorius, (Telling the Sogdian Story). Nestorius had different opinions when it came to the Holy Trinity that differed from mainstream Christianity. He believed that Christ on Earth and Christ in heaven were two separate beings, (Telling the Sogdian Story).Ultimately his teachings were confronted and condemned at the Council of Ephesus, where Nestorius was accused of heresy, (New Advent).<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

        <p>Due to these outstanding circumstances, the Church had to move way from Byzantine antagonism and settle down in Mesopotamia, (Telling the Sogdian Story). However, the Church of the East did not stay settled down for long as it did progress down the Silk Road much like other religions of the time. The Christian Church of the East had a respectable following on the Mesopotamia, but the spread of Christianity was not as affluent farther east such as in China at the time being. However, all of this was going to change. While the Christian Church of the East may have not been extremely dominant, preserved records from the era show that it did reach China and influenced the area immensely.<a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
