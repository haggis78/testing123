Ben, here is the to-do list for your traveler page:
1) Enlarge map to same size as the others (we'll look at this in class tomorrow)
2) Add route lines to your map
3) Fix bibliography
4) Add links to passages in the text. We'll talk about this in class on Wednesday, but for the moment, I'll note that an accessible electronic text is at https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.62617 .

As a reminder, you're also working on an article now on the Christian Church of the East (aka Nestorians).
