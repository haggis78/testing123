Ben, here is the to-do list for your traveler page:
1) Enlarge map to same size as the others (we'll look at this in class tomorrow) [Tried to but need help]
2) Add route lines to your map [Done]
3) Fix bibliography [Done]
4) Add links to passages in the text. We'll talk about this in class on Wednesday, but for the moment, I'll note that an accessible electronic text is at https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.62617 . [Working on it, about 25% done, need to fix notes as well]

As a reminder, you're also working on an article now on the Christian Church of the East (aka Nestorians). [Done]
