        <h1>Ibn Battuta</h1>
        <p>Some people travel across towns while others travel across the globe. Ibn Battuta, (1304-1369), was a Muslim Moroccan scholar who explored the ends of the earth. Ibn Battuta never stood still for long. He always had a desire to set out and see the world, especially parts that had Islamic influence. </p>
        <p>Ibn Battuta started traveling at a very young age, setting out on a journey to Mecca at the age of twenty-one. From here, his life became all about exploring what this world had to offer. He was fascinated with stories from the far east. Stories that included Muslim Kingdoms, religious opportunities, and even fierce battles between feuding kingdoms. </p>
        <p>Sitting still was never on the agenda for Ibn Battuta. Following his third pilgrimage to Mecca, he decided he wanted to go out east. However, his goal was not to play tourist this time, but instead he was eager to seek employment from Muhammad bin Tughluq, the Sultan of Delhi.</p>
        <p>Ibn Battuta started his journey through Anatolia, but this map will begin his journey as he dwells into places he had never gone to before. Starting from the Crimean Peninsula, Battuta wanted to explore the Muslim world he had never seen before. On the way, he saw great sights of Islamic prosperity as well as the opposite. Battuta also spoke with Mongol leaders along with other people of power.</p>
        <p>Ibn Battuta stayed in Delhi for five years serving as a judge. He left under scrutiny and carried on down the coast of India and decided to explore even more, going all the way to the East Coast of China before traversing back home. Ibn Battutaâ€™s journeys all prove to be fascinating, yet this detour to try and encounter the Islamic world on the Silk Road is exceptionally captivating.</p>
