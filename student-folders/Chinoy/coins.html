        <h1>Coins and Currency along the Silk Road</h1>
        <p>While silk, as the name would imply, and other physical goods were the primary medium of trade along the Silk Road, hard currency did play an important role in commerce along the route, in the form of coinage from various empires: gold Byzantine coins, silver Sasanian coins, and of course the ubiquitous cast bronze "Cash" coins, minted both in China and at points along the Silk Road. While the actual circulation of this coinage in everyday transactions appears to have been rather limited, they were still valuable assets for traders to easily transport large amounts of value, for travelers and pilgrims to pay their way across Asia, and for ceremonial purposes.</p>

        <p>Gold coins appear very infrequently at Silk Road sites: only 48 have been discovered in China, all Byzantine "solidus" coins dating to the 530s-540s AD. [21][158] (Contrary to popular belief, Roman-era trade with China did not involve the direct exchange of Roman coinage for silk [7]; no earlier Roman coins of any type are known to have appeared in China.) These typically appear individually, having been used as decorations sewn onto clothing as protective talismans, or else buried with the dead, placed over eyes or in mouths to provide the deceased with some money in the afterlife. [153] Many have turned out to be imitations. [158] Gold used as currency usually took the form of bars; there is relatively little record of commerce conducted directly with gold coins anywhere along the Silk Road. [159]</p>

		<p>A total of roughly 1,300 silver coins from the Sasanian empire have been excavated in China, almost entirely in Xinjiang, at sites along the Silk Road. Brought eastward to Turfan by migrating Sogdians by around 300 AD, Persian silver coinage became the dominant form of hard currency in Central Asia for much of the Silk Road era. The official history of the Wei dynasty attests to the prevalence of silver there, describing that the residents of Kucha, further west along the northern side of the Taklamakan, paid their tributary taxes in silver coin. A Chinese monk visiting this Kingdom in 629 reports the use of silver, gold, and locally-minted copper/bronze coin.[116] Silver coin in Central Asia took the form of Drachm coins, a traditional classical-Greek denomination, or Staters, the value of which, where attested in Sogdian documents, is uncertain.[200]</p>
		<p>At a remote site along the route west of Turfan, a massive hidden cache of 947 silver coins (and 13 gold bars) was discovered in 1959, the largest hoard of silver coin thus far discovered in China. [155] Among these are both typical Sasanian coins as well as later Arabo-Sasanian coins, with designs altered to incorporate arabic script, minted after the Islamic conquest of Persia in 651&mdash;an indication that despite ongoing conflict between the peoples of Central Asia and the encroaching Muslim armies, the traditional use of their silver coins persisted.[156] Surviving documents from Turfan indicate the common use of silver coinage by residents there during the 6th-7th centuries. Various documents involving loans and business transactions there often depict silver coin, silk, and grain in use as parallel currencies, sometimes combined in a single payment; a market register lists prices for various goods in quantities of silver coin. By the 8th c., the Arabic silver dirham had replaced the Sasanian drachm as the form of silver coin throughout the Islamic world, reaching as far as Samarkand. [216] As silver coinage was not minted locally, its use farther east along the Silk Road largely died out in the 8th c.</p>

        <p><i>Above: tied bundles of bronze coin; a single Wuzhu coin minted under Emperor Wen (early 6th c.)</i></p> 
		<p>One of the most well-known symbols of Imperial China, known throughout the world, is the "cash": bronze coins cast in molds (as opposed to being struck by dies like most other coinage around the world), marked with several characters on one or both sides, with a square hole through the center. This hole is used to tie bundles of coin with string, often in quantities of 100. Most transactions were conducted with whole bundles instead of individual coins, owing to their very low intrinsic metal value compared to silver and gold&mdash;in fact, bolts of silk functioned as currency so extensively because they were actually lighter and easier to transport than its equivalent value in coin! Within China, coins of this general style were in use continuously for almost the entire span of its history, from the 4th c. BC through to the fall of the Qing in 1911. All such coins remained valid currency and could easily remain in circulation for over 1,000 years. (Imagine finding an ancient Anglo-Saxon penny in your pocket change!) The type of cash used during much of the Silk Road era was the "Wuzhu" coin, bearing two characters on the obverse and a blank reverse, minted from the Han dynasty through to the Tang; these were superseded by "Kaiyuan Tongbao" coins in 621 AD. Similar coinage was sometimes minted outside China and circulated alongside standard Chinese coinage: at Khotan, distinctive locally-minted Sino-Kharoshthi coinage dated to around the 3rd c. combines design elements of both Chinese and Kushan coins. (The various copper coins minted in Khotan and Sogdiana over the centuries were for local use, not long-distance trade, and do not appear in China.)</p>
		<p>Chinese bronze coin certainly traveled great distances along the Silk Road: among 7th-century finds at Panjikent, near Samarkand, thousands of bronze coins have been found, both Chinese and locally-minted, alongside Sasanian silver coins. [204] In terms of local circulation, however, the Silk Road was originally divided into two spheres of currency use: silver dominated at Turfan and all points west (alongside local coinage), while Chinese bronze coin dominated at all points east of Turfan, approaching China's interior. [157] By around 700 AD, the use of bronze coin spread to Turfan, displacing silver. Officially, Tang government accounting was performed in aggregate units of three parallel currencies&mdash;bronze coin, textiles, and grain,&mdash;any or all of which could be used equally.[306] The actual usage of bronze coin at remote frontier locations, even after the decline in usage of silver, is not always clear: mid-8th c.documents from Dandan Uiliq, near Khotan, record loans and transactions in quantities of coins, but also list standard exchange rates of cloth and grain to be substituted for physical coin in said payments, as coins were often unavailable.[355] The same shortage of coin at this time, owing to the weakening of Tang military power in the wake of the An Lushan rebellion, is attested at Dunhuang as well. A century later, the monetary crunch still had not been fully resolved: the official stated purpose of the Imperial ban on foreign religions (Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and briefly even Buddhism) in 845 AD was to seize their bronze statues, bells, etc. for scrap, in order to increase the supply available for minting coins.[260] Following the fall of the Tang and the Tibetan conquest of Dunhuang and the surrounding region, the circulation of Chinese coin along the Silk Road sharply declined.</p>
        <p>An oddity in the archaeological record of coinage in Silk Road-era China is found in the early-8th c. hoard of treasures unearthed at Hejia Village, on the outskirts of Chang'an: a group of diverse coins, 478 in total, that appears to represent a coin collection in the modern-day sense. It consists of both foreign coins&mdash;one Sasanian and five Japanese silver coins, the latter of which do not appear anywhere further along on the Silk Road, plus an imitation gold Solidus&mdash;and historic and contemporary Chinese coins. The Chinese coins represent everything from ancient "spade money" and Han-dynasty bronze coins, to commonly circulating bronze coins from the time the hoard was buried, as well as commemorative silver and gold issues. The purpose of this collection is unknown, perhaps it was the prize possession of a private citizen, or a reference collection maintained by an employee of the Chinese mint.</p>
