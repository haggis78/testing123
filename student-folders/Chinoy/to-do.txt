Connor, here are the things I'd like you to do for your traveler page:
1. Links to the passages in the source text
2. I'd like you to attempt a timeline using the tool timeline.js. This can be dropped into your traveler page below the map, using an <iframe> element just like the one used for the map.

You also have a new article on Zoroastrianism to be working on.
