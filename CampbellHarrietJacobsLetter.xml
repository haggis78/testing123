    <mainText>... I hope you will call &amp; see, if <person status="enslaved">she</person> is now
        in <placeref place="Philadelphia">the city</placeref>, one of the most interesting cases of
        escape from slavery that you have ever seen. She was sent from <placeref city="Philadelphia"
            state="Pennsylvania">this city</placeref>
        <date day="24 June 1842">yesterday morning</date> &amp; consigned to <person
            status="nonslave">Mr. Johnston</person>. She is from <placeref state="North Carolina"
            >N.C.</placeref> was brought away by <person status="nonslave">a sea captain</person>.
        She was sold by <person status="nonslave">her master</person> to the <person
            status="nonslave">speculators</person> &amp; to avoid being sent away she was hidden for
        7 years! in a small upper room of a house occupied by <person status="nonslave">colored
            people</person> &amp; within a hundred yards of <person status="nonslave">her
            master</person>'s house, who did not know she was there. She had not seen <person
            status="enslaved">her boy</person>, for 7 years till within 3 days of her coming away.
        She has been shut up so long that she can hardly walk. <person status="enslaved">Another
            woman</person> was brought away from <placeref state="Delaware">Delaware</placeref>, who
        was found tied to a tree. If <person status="nonslave">Mr. Johnston</person> was the man he
        ought to be, he would invite you occasionally to see some of these remarkable cases, which
        are continually passing from <placeref city="Philadelphia" state="Pennsylvania"
            >Phil.</placeref> to <placeref state="New York State" city="New York City"
            >N.Y.</placeref> The Vagrant what a queer mistake. The Vigilance Committee of this city
        are doing a fine business in weakening &amp; delapidating the edifice of slavery. Success to
        them...</mainText>
